      <p>Growing up on a small farm in Fiji, I was surrounded by a rhythm of life that felt deeply connected to the land, the community, and the traditions passed down over generations. Just next to our farm was a small village known for one thing: its pottery.
      </p>
      <p>For centuries, women in this village have practiced the art of clay pottery—using nothing more than sand, clay, water, and a natural gum from a local tree. 100% sustainable. 100% beautiful. And 100% rooted in heritage.
      </p>
<p>Today, that same village is home to a women-run co-op, where mothers, grandmothers, and daughters continue this tradition from the comfort of their homes. They craft clay pots by hand, teach their children the art, and sell their work to earn a living—without ever needing to leave the community that raised them. My family has supported these artisans over the years, purchasing their pots for nearly every important occasion—from my grandmother’s funeral to my own wedding.
</p>
<p>>These women aren’t just preserving an art form. They’re building a sustainable economy—one that values cultural knowledge, regenerative practices, and the well-being of future generations.
</p><p>But even in a place so rich with tradition and talent, I witnessed something troubling: most of the money from Fiji’s booming tourism industry never stayed in Fiji. It left the islands through outside-owned businesses, leaving local artisans, farmers, and small shopkeepers behind.
</p><p>That disconnect stayed with me as I pursued a career in technology and aviation, working across industries that shape how people move, connect, and experience the world. It was clear: if we want to build a more sustainable future, we can’t just talk about emissions—we have to talk about economies. Specifically, local economies. The kind that empower women to work from home, that keep cultural crafts alive, that give children both pride and opportunity.
</p><p>That’s how the vision for PerkTogether was born.
</p><p>A platform designed to revitalize local, circular economies—starting with the places and people we love. A way to connect eco-conscious consumers, local businesses, and even large corporations with ESG goals, all in support of regenerative, community-driven impact. We reward sustainable behaviors, but the real reward is this: money stays in the community, artisans stay in business, and traditions stay alive.
</p><p>This is more than a tech solution. It’s a return to what we already know: that small actions, when rooted in community, can power real change.
And for me, it all started with a clay pot.
